# Tsunami Prediction Model

Hi there! This is a project I made for PSTAT 131 at UCSB. The purpose of this project is to build prediction models for tsunami risk using earthquake data. The data was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasur965/recent-earthquakes). I built this project in R, and the final project report is available in RMD, PDF, or HTML format. Thanks for stopping by!
